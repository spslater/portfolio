I originally wrote this for [/r/littlenuns](https://www.reddit.com/r/LittleNuns)
to grab [@hyxpk](https://twitter.com/hyxpk)'s daily images and post them on the
subreddit. After working on it a bit, I tried to generalize it but haven't
tested it with any other user or subreddit. It has been archived with both
Reddit's and Twitter's API limits.
