Batch Renamer (brp) is a repl cli program I wrote when I found the need to
rename a bunch of files in a similar way (usually using some regex pattern). The
catalyst for writing brp was when I was ripping some tv shows and I needed all
the filenames to match. This made it a much less painful process. There are gui
applications that solve this but I needed something for my linux server.
