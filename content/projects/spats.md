The *SPATS Personal Asset Tracking Software* (SPATS) is an application I'm
working on that helps track things you own (your personal assets). I haven't
found any selfhosted software that is tailored to just a single household. ~I also called it SPATS because I think that recursive names are fun and silly and I like that.~
