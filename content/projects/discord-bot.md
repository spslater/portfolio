The `whatno` Discord bot is primarily used in the fan server for the
webcomic *Dumbing of Age*. I adjust it for whatever we decide we want, like
a daily group reread of the comic or collecting stats on how we feel about the
current comics. I was also working on a bot that would notify users of when a
new chapter of a manga was published on MangaDex using their new API, but I've
put that on hold for now.
