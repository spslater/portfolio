# Hello There
I write software, mostly for myself right now but have done for Amazon in the
past. I want to do more backend and non-web development programming but somehow
all my personal projects end up being websites. I'm interested in finding ways
that software can help others.

When outside, I enjoy running, cycling, and rock climbing.

I have two lovely black cats Babs and Raven that I love to spoil. ([cat tax]({{< ref "cattax.md" >}}))
